## 👋 Hey there, I'm Ojas!  
Welcome to **Brain_Box** — my personal project that mixes **sci-fi vibes, memes, and AI**  
into one tool that makes studying way less painful.  

---

## 🎯 The Mission  
The idea is simple:  
**Turn long, messy study material into clean notes you can actually use.**  

Because let’s be real:  
- Nobody loves scrolling endless PDFs.  
- Copy-pasting into Word? Mid.  
- Reading the same line over and over? Pain.  

So I thought — why not let AI handle the boring part?  
And *boom*, Brain_Box was born. ⚡

---

## 🛠️ What Brain_Box Does  
- 📄 Takes in your **PDFs (textbooks, notes, research papers, etc.)**  
- ✂️ Breaks them down into smaller chunks  
- 🧠 Uses AI to **summarize the important stuff**  
- 📝 Spits out **simple, clear notes** that don’t waste your time  

Basically, it’s like that topper friend… minus the flexing.  

---

## 🌌 The Vibe  
Brain_Box isn’t your average boring tool.  
It comes with:  
- ✅ **Sci-fi aesthetic** (feel like Iron Man while studying)  
- ✅ A sprinkle of **memes** (because life’s too short for dull notes)  
- ✅ **Minimalist UI** that doesn’t cook your eyes
